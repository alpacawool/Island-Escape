# Island-Escape
School C++ Project to create a text-based game

This was a school project with the following requirements (briefly)-
* C++ language
* Have "spaces" that point to each other making a 2-D grid
* Have a player with an inventory
* The player can win or lose the game
* Have a goal to win

From there, we are given freedom to choose a theme
and add features as long as requirements were met.
